During my 1-month internship at **Elite Techno Groups**, I worked on a variety of projects that involved developing systems and performing data analysis tasks. Below are the key assignments I worked on:

## Assignments & Projects:

### **Inventory Management System (Assignment-1)**
- **Task:** Developed an **Inventory Management System** designed to track and manage stock levels, product information, and transactions.
- **Contribution:** Implemented core functionality for adding, updating, and deleting inventory items. Ensured proper data validation and efficient handling of inventory records.

### **Summer Olympic Data Analysis (Assignment-2)**
- **Task:** Conducted data analysis on historical **Summer Olympic Games** data.
- **Contribution:** Analyzed Olympic performance data (e.g., medal counts, top-performing countries) using Python and Pandas. Visualized trends and insights through various charts and graphs.


### **Breast Cancer Detection (Breast-Cancer-Detection)**
- **Task:** Worked on a project involving **Breast Cancer Detection** using machine learning models.
- **Contribution:** Implemented data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values and feature scaling. Applied machine learning algorithms such as **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** for binary classification tasks.

### **USA Cars Analysis (USA_cars_analysis)**
- **Task:** Analyzed the **USA Cars Dataset**, which contained information about used cars for sale in the United States.
- **Contribution:** Cleaned the dataset, performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), and built insights on car prices, features, and market trends.

## Skills and Tools Used:
- **Programming Languages:** Python, Jupyter Notebooks
- **Libraries/Tools:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, NumPy
- **Version Control:** Git/GitHub

## Key Takeaways:
- Gained practical experience in developing and managing real-world data systems.
- Enhanced data analysis and machine learning skills, especially in handling large datasets and making data-driven decisions.
- Learned to effectively collaborate on project documentation and version control.
